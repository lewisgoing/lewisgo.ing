## Project Overview

<InfoBox type="info">
  This research was conducted at the University of Washington's Information School, exploring how novice music creators collaborate with AI over an extended period.
</InfoBox>

This project investigated how AI is transforming creative collaboration in music production, particularly for novices without formal musical training. While AI tools for music production have proliferated, little research has examined their long-term use in group settings with multiple interacting AI systems.

Our study followed undergraduate students as they created complete music projects with AI assistance across the entire production lifecycle - from initial concept to final released tracks on Spotify. By observing the entire creative journey, we uncovered new insights into human-AI co-creation that traditional short-term lab studies miss.

## The Problem

Artificial intelligence has opened new possibilities for creativity across domains, but much remains unknown about how AI shapes extended collaborative processes. Existing research on human-AI co-creation has primarily focused on:

1. Individual creator interactions
2. Short-term, single-session activities
3. Single AI tools rather than ecosystems of AI helpers

This gap is particularly significant in music production - an inherently collaborative creative domain that involves multiple stages and specialized roles like composition, arrangement, mixing, and mastering.

### Research Questions

Our study investigated:

1. What are the stages of the co-creative process when novice users collaborate with AI in music production?
2. What relationships and roles do humans and AI assume in this process?
3. How do users perceive AI in this process?

## Methodology

We conducted a case study of undergraduate students in a 10-week capstone course where teams of 4-6 students with limited musical experience collaboratively produced three original tracks released as EPs on Spotify.

Data collection included:
- Review of course materials, process logs, and final songs
- Nine in-depth interviews (55-70 minutes) with students from three teams
- Analysis of published music and team websites

Using abductive analysis, we identified themes in collaboration dynamics, challenges, and creative processes, then mapped these to Amabile's Componential Model of Creativity to develop our extended theoretical framework.

## Key Findings

### 1. Transformations to the Creative Process

AI significantly altered the traditional creative workflow:

<InfoBox type="flag">
  We discovered a new creative stage not in traditional models: "Collaging, Refining, and Integration" - where creators must assemble diverse AI outputs into a cohesive whole.
</InfoBox>

- **Compressed Preparation Stage**: AI enabled rapid ideation without extensive knowledge-building, sometimes bypassing traditional learning phases
- **Accelerated Ideation**: AI served as a powerful inspiration source but risked idea fixation on initial outputs
- **Challenging Validation**: Novices struggled to evaluate numerous AI-generated options without domain expertise
- **Integration Difficulties**: Combining outputs from multiple AI tools was technically challenging and time-consuming

### 2. AI-Mediated Social Dynamics

AI transformed team interactions in unexpected ways:

- **Emotional Buffer**: Team members felt more comfortable critiquing AI outputs than human contributions
- **Role Flexibility**: AI was variously perceived as a "teammate," technical assistant, or domain expert
- **Control Tensions**: Participants struggled to balance AI assistance with maintaining creative ownership

</CodeBlock>

### 3. Impact on Creative Expression

Participants reported mixed effects on their creative experience:

- **Enhanced Self-Efficacy**: AI boosted confidence by lowering barriers to entry
- **Emotional Connection**: Many felt AI outputs lacked the emotional depth of human-created music
- **Constraints on Artistry**: Some found AI limited hands-on experimentation and personal expression

## The Human-AI Co-Creation Stage Model

Based on our findings, we developed a new model that extends Amabile's Componential Model of Creativity to account for AI's influence:

![Human-AI Co-Creation Stage Model](/images/projects/ai-music-collab/stage-model.jpg)

The model illustrates:
1. How AI often shortens or bypasses preparation stages
2. The rapid movement from ideation to validation
3. The new "Collaging & Integration" stage unique to AI co-creation
4. How AI impacts progress looping and iteration

## The Human-AI Agency Model

We also proposed a model positioning users in the driver's seat of creative control:

![Human-AI Agency Model](/images/projects/ai-music-collab/agency-model.jpg)

This model contrasts:
- **AI-Led Creation**: Where one-click generation risks reduced human input and ownership
- **Human-Led Creation**: Where AI selectively supports human goals and expression

## Design Implications

Our research suggests several principles for designing better AI co-creative tools:

### For Creative Process Support

1. **Support Domain Knowledge Building**: Help users develop foundational knowledge alongside generation capabilities
2. **Promote Broad Exploration**: Guide users beyond initial ideas to avoid fixation
3. **Provide Editable Outputs**: Enable flexible formats for easier integration
4. **Enable Multi-User Collaboration**: Design for team interactions, not just individual creators

### For Human Agency Support

<InfoBox type="warning">
  One-click AI generation risks diminishing human agency and reducing creators to mere prompt engineers.
</InfoBox>

1. **Facilitate "Controlled Serendipity"**: Preserve exploratory discovery while supporting efficiency
2. **Foster Growth-Oriented Skill Development**: Track progress and provide adaptive challenges
3. **Support Emotional Expression**: Help users infuse personal meaning rather than replacing it
4. **Balance Easy Entry with Mastery**: "Easy to use, hard to master" design principles

## Challenges & Learnings

The research revealed several tensions in human-AI co-creation:

1. **Efficiency vs. Engagement**: AI accelerates production but may reduce deeper engagement
2. **Quantity vs. Quality**: More options don't necessarily lead to better creative decisions
3. **Technical Support vs. Creative Partnership**: Different conceptualizations of AI's role affect how people use it
4. **Novice Confidence vs. Skill Development**: Immediate success may limit long-term growth

## Conclusion

Our study extends understanding of collaborative human-AI co-creation by examining the entire creative process from conception to completion. While AI accelerates idea generation and lowers barriers to entry for novices, it also introduces unique challenges in integration and idea selection.

Future AI co-creation systems should foster human creativity, collaboration, and skill development, enhancing rather than eclipsing the essential human experiences of artistic expression. As AI becomes increasingly embedded in creative workflows, our models provide frameworks for understanding these evolving relationships and designing more supportive tools.
