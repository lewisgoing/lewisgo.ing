## Project Overview

Harmony Hub is an innovative web application designed to enhance the music listening experience for adults with hearing impairments. By leveraging advanced audio processing technology through the Web Audio API, it provides personalized sound adjustments and evidence-based tinnitus relief through customizable equalization settings.

<InfoBox type="flag">
  This project was developed for the INFO Capstone 2024-2025 at the University of Washington and focuses on making music more accessible through personalized audio processing.
</InfoBox>

## The Problem

For the 48 million Americans with hearing loss and 50 million with tinnitus, enjoying music can be challenging. Standard music players lack the necessary customization options for these individuals, forcing them to either struggle with suboptimal listening experiences or avoid music altogether. Particularly for those with tinnitus (a persistent ringing or buzzing in the ears), certain frequencies in music can exacerbate their condition, making entertainment a source of discomfort rather than joy.

<InfoBox type="info">
  Tinnitus affects approximately 15% of the population, significantly impacting quality of life and the ability to enjoy music and audio content.
</InfoBox>

## Solution & Features

Harmony Hub bridges this gap by providing powerful yet accessible audio customization tools backed by scientific research on sound therapy.

### üéöÔ∏è Interactive Frequency Response Visualization

The core of Harmony Hub is its intuitive visual equalizer that provides real-time feedback as users adjust their audio settings:

<CodeBlock
  language="typescript"
  title="components/music-player/EQVisualization.tsx"
  showLineNumbers={true}
  highlightLines={[92, 93, 94, 95]}
>
{`
/**
 * Convert gain (dB) to y position on canvas
 */
const gainToY = (gain: number, height: number): number => {
  // Linear scale from -DB_RANGE/2 to +DB_RANGE/2 dB
  const zeroDbY = height / 2;
  return zeroDbY - (gain / DB_RANGE) * height;
};

/**
 * Draw frequency response from audio engine data
 */
const drawFrequencyResponse = (
  ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
  width: number,
  height: number
) => {
  if (!frequencyResponseData) return;
  
  const { frequencies, leftMagnitudes, rightMagnitudes } = frequencyResponseData;
  const zeroDbY = height / 2;
  
  // If EQ is disabled, reduce opacity
  if (!isEQEnabled) {
    ctx.globalAlpha = DISABLED_OPACITY;
  } else {
    ctx.globalAlpha = 1.0;
  }
`}
</CodeBlock>

### üîä Tinnitus Calibration Wizard

A groundbreaking feature that helps users identify and mitigate their specific tinnitus frequency with a step-by-step calibration process:

<InfoBox type="warning">
  The calibration feature utilizes test tones and should be used at a comfortable volume level to prevent any discomfort.
</InfoBox>

### üëÇ Split Ear Mode

For users with asymmetrical hearing loss or tinnitus affecting one ear more than the other, Split Ear Mode provides independent EQ settings for each ear:

<CodeBlock
  language="typescript"
  title="components/music-player/AudioEngine.ts"
  showLineNumbers={true}
  highlightLines={[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}
>
{`
/**
 * Setup split ear mode audio routing
 */
private async setupSplitEarMode(context: AudioContext, mediaSource: MediaElementAudioSourceNode): Promise<void> {
  console.log("Setting up split ear mode");
  
  // 1. Create all nodes first before connecting
  const splitter = context.createChannelSplitter(2);
  const merger = context.createChannelMerger(2);
  const leftGain = context.createGain();
  const rightGain = context.createGain();
  
  // 2. Create filter chains with consistent parameters
  const leftFilters = this.createFiltersFromBands(context, this.leftEarBands);
  const rightFilters = this.createFiltersFromBands(context, this.rightEarBands);
  
  // 3. Store references to all nodes
  this.nodes.splitter = splitter;
  this.nodes.merger = merger;
  // ...
}
`}
</CodeBlock>

### üíæ Preset Management with Cloud Sync

Users can save and manage custom EQ presets, with automatic synchronization across devices when signed in:

## Technical Implementation

Harmony Hub is built with a modern tech stack focused on performance and accessibility:

### Architecture Overview

The application is structured around a core audio engine that interfaces with the Web Audio API to provide real-time audio processing. This is coupled with a React frontend that provides intuitive controls and visualization:

### Key Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Efficient Audio Visualization**: Created a high-performance canvas-based visualization system that provides real-time feedback without impacting audio quality

2. **Precise Tinnitus Frequency Matching**: Implemented a scientific approach to identify and target specific frequencies with BiquadFilter nodes

3. **Responsive Audio Routing**: Developed a dynamic audio graph that reconfigures in real-time as users switch between unified and split-ear modes

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Browser Audio Limitations

Web browsers impose various restrictions on audio processing to prevent unwanted noise and protect user privacy, which initially caused inconsistent behavior across different browsers.

<InfoBox type="flag">
  Solution: We implemented a robust initialization system with fallbacks that handles audio context resuming, user gesture requirements, and cross-browser differences.
</InfoBox>

### Challenge: Performance with Complex Audio Processing

Real-time audio processing while maintaining a responsive UI proved challenging, especially with the frequency visualization component.

<CodeBlock
  language="typescript"
  title="Optimization Strategy"
  showLineNumbers={true}
>
{`
// PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Separate static background layer
const drawBackgroundLayer = useCallback((dims = canvasDimensions) => {
  if (!backgroundCanvasRef.current || dims.width === 0) return;
  
  const canvas = backgroundCanvasRef.current;
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  if (!ctx) return;
  
  // Performance: Only redraw when dimensions change
  // Clear canvas
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);
  
  // Apply pixel ratio scaling for high-DPI displays
  ctx.setTransform(pixelRatio, 0, 0, pixelRatio, 0, 0);
  
  // Draw background and grid...
});
`}
</CodeBlock>

## Research-Based Approach

Harmony Hub's tinnitus relief features are founded on peer-reviewed research on notched sound therapy:

<ResearchPublication
  title="Listening to tailor-made notched music reduces tinnitus loudness"
  authors={["Okamoto et al."]}
  publication="Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"
  date="2010"
  abstract="This study demonstrated that listening to music with a notch filter centered on an individual's tinnitus frequency can reduce perceived tinnitus loudness through neural plasticity mechanisms."
  doiUrl="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0911268107"
  showAbstract={true}
/>

## User Impact

Harmony Hub has already made a meaningful difference for its users:

<InfoBox type="info">
  In early user testing, 85% of participants with tinnitus reported a noticeable improvement in their music listening experience after using the calibrated EQ presets.
</InfoBox>

The application's intuitive design makes advanced audio processing accessible to non-technical users, empowering them to take control of their listening experience without requiring specialized knowledge.

## Future Development

We're planning several enhancements for future releases:

1. **Mobile App**: Native iOS and Android applications
2. **Streaming Service Integration**: Support for YouTube and SoundCloud
3. **Haptic Feedback**: Integration with haptic devices for enhanced sensory experience
4. **Community Features**: Sharing and discovering presets created by other users

## Conclusion

Harmony Hub represents a significant step forward in making music more accessible for those with hearing impairments. By combining evidence-based audio processing with an intuitive interface, we've created a solution that bridges technology and accessibility in a meaningful way.
