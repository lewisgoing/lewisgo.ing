      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Harmony Hub aims to bridge the gap between music enjoyment and hearing impairments by providing tools that allow users to personalize their listening experience. Our application particularly focuses on supporting individuals with tinnitus through evidence-based sound therapy approaches integrated into a music player.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      
      <h4>üéöÔ∏è Personalized Equalizer</h4>
      <p>
        Interactive EQ with frequency band adjustments, allowing users to customize sound based on their hearing profile. Double-click points to adjust Q-value (width of frequency adjustments) with visual feedback through real-time frequency response curves.
      </p>
      
      <h4>üîä Tinnitus Calibration</h4>
      <p>
        A step-by-step wizard guides users to identify their exact tinnitus frequency and creates personalized "notch filter" presets based on clinical research. This evidence-based approach uses notched sound therapy techniques shown to reduce tinnitus perception over time.
      </p>
      
      <h4>üëÇ Split Ear Mode</h4>
      <p>
        Configures different EQ settings for each ear with independent preset selection for left and right channels and balance control between them - perfect for asymmetric hearing conditions.
      </p>
      
      <h4>üíæ Presets Management</h4>
      <p>
        Includes built-in presets designed for common hearing needs, custom user presets for personal configurations, and specialized tinnitus presets created through the calibration process.
      </p>
      
      <h4>‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Sync</h4>
      <p>
        Save settings across devices with cloud synchronization when signed in, with offline functionality through local storage for a seamless experience.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Research Background</h3>
      <p>
        Harmony Hub's tinnitus relief features are based on peer-reviewed research on notched sound therapy, including Okamoto et al. (2010) - "Listening to tailor-made notched music reduces tinnitus loudness" and Pantev et al. (2012) - "Transient auditory plasticity in human auditory cortex induced by tailor-made notched music training."
      </p>
      
      <h3>Development Team</h3>
      <p>
        This project was developed by the Hearing Heroes team for the INFO Capstone 2024-2025 at the University of Washington, including Lewis Going, Bella Gatz, Paul Garces, Nathaniel Sayasack, and Brooke Pedersen.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The application leverages the Web Audio API for real-time audio processing, with custom hooks for managing EQ settings, audio context, and cloud synchronization. The UI is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions. Firebase and Firestore provide authentication and database features for cloud synchronization.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Future Development</h3>
      <p>
        Plans for future development include a native mobile app, integration with streaming services like YouTube and SoundCloud, advanced calibration features, haptic feedback support, AI-driven personalized recommendations, and community features for sharing presets.
      </p>
